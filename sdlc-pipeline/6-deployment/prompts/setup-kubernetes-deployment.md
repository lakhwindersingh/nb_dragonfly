```
### 2.2 Database Migration

```sql
-- 1. Create backup
pg_dump -h [host] -U [user] -d [database] > backup_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).sql

-- 2. Run migration scripts
\i migration_v[version].sql

-- 3. Verify migration
SELECT version FROM schema_migrations ORDER BY version DESC LIMIT 1;
```
### 2.3 Application Deployment

```bash
# 1. Deploy application using Blue-Green strategy
kubectl apply -f k8s/blue-green-deployment.yaml

# 2. Wait for rollout to complete
kubectl rollout status deployment/[app-name]-blue

# 3. Run health checks
kubectl exec [pod-name] -- curl -f http://localhost:8080/actuator/health

# 4. Switch traffic to new version
kubectl patch service [service-name] -p '{"spec":{"selector":{"version":"blue"}}}'

# 5. Verify traffic switch
kubectl get service [service-name] -o yaml
```
### 2.4 Configuration Updates

```bash
# 1. Update configuration maps
kubectl create configmap [config-name] --from-file=config/ --dry-run=client -o yaml | kubectl apply -f -

# 2. Update secrets
kubectl create secret generic [secret-name] --from-literal=key=value --dry-run=client -o yaml | kubectl apply -f -

# 3. Restart pods to pick up new configuration
kubectl rollout restart deployment/[app-name]
```
## 3. Post-Deployment Verification
### 3.1 Application Health Checks

```bash
# 1. Check application status
kubectl get pods -l app=[app-name]
kubectl describe pod [pod-name]

# 2. Verify application endpoints
curl -f https://[domain]/health
curl -f https://[domain]/actuator/health

# 3. Check application logs
kubectl logs -f deployment/[app-name] --since=10m
```
### 3.2 Functional Verification

- Report generation functional

### 3.3 Performance Verification

```bash
# 1. Check response times
curl -w "@curl-format.txt" -o /dev/null -s https://[domain]/api/health

# 2. Monitor resource usage
kubectl top pods
kubectl top nodes

# 3. Check database performance
# Monitor slow query logs and connection pools
```
### 3.4 Security Verification

- Response time alerts
- Resource utilization alerts
- Database connection alerts
- Security incident alerts

### 4.3 Log Aggregation

```bash
# 1. Verify log collection
kubectl logs -n logging fluentd-[pod-id]

# 2. Check log forwarding
curl http://elasticsearch:9200/_cluster/health

# 3. Verify log parsing and indexing
curl http://kibana:5601/api/status
```
## 5. Rollback Procedure
### 5.1 Rollback Decision Criteria
Initiate rollback if:
- Application availability < 99%
- Error rate > 5%
- Response time > 5 seconds
- Critical security vulnerability discovered
- Data corruption detected
- Business stakeholder requests rollback

### 5.2 Rollback Steps

```bash
# 1. Immediate rollback using Kubernetes
kubectl rollout undo deployment/[app-name]

# 2. Verify rollback status
kubectl rollout status deployment/[app-name]

# 3. Switch traffic back to previous version
kubectl patch service [service-name] -p '{"spec":{"selector":{"version":"green"}}}'

# 4. Database rollback (if needed)
psql -h [host] -U [user] -d [database] -f rollback_v[version].sql

# 5. Verify application functionality
curl -f https://[domain]/health
```
