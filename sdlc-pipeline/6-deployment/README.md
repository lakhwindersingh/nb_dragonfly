# Deployment Stage

## Objective

Deploy applications in production or staging environments using automated, reliable, and scalable deployment strategies with proper monitoring and rollback capabilities.

## Deployment Strategies

- **Blue-Green Deployment**: Zero-downtime deployments
- **Canary Deployment**: Gradual rollout with monitoring
- **Rolling Deployment**: Sequential instance updates
- **Feature Flags**: Controlled feature releases
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Automated infrastructure provisioning

## Artifacts Generated
- CI/CD Pipeline Configurations
- Infrastructure as Code Templates
- Container Orchestration Manifests
- Monitoring and Alerting Configurations
- Deployment Runbooks and SOPs
- Rollback Procedures
- Environment Configuration Management

## Templates Available
- `cicd-pipeline-template/`
- `kubernetes-deployment-template/`
- `terraform-infrastructure-template/`
- `monitoring-setup-template/`
- `deployment-runbook-template.md`

## Prompts Available
- `create-cicd-pipeline.md`
- `setup-kubernetes-deployment.md`
- `generate-infrastructure-code.md`
- `configure-monitoring.md`

## Input Dependencies
- Tested application artifacts
- Infrastructure requirements
