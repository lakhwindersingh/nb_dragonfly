# Requirements Analysis Stage

## Objective
Gather and formalize detailed functional and non-functional requirements that translate project charter objectives into specific system capabilities.

## Artifacts Generated
- Software Requirements Specification (SRS)
- Use Case Diagrams
- User Stories with Acceptance Criteria
- Data Flow Diagrams
- Non-Functional Requirements Matrix

## Templates Available
- `srs-template.md`
- `user-story-template.md`
- `use-case-template.md`
- `nfr-matrix-template.md`

## Prompts Available
- `generate-srs.md`
- `create-user-stories.md`
- `design-use-cases.md`
- `define-nfr.md`

## Input Dependencies
- Project Charter (scope, objectives, stakeholders)
- Business requirements and constraints
- User personas and scenarios

## Output Flow
Requirements outputs feed directly into Design stage, providing:
- Functional specifications for system design
- User interaction patterns for UI/UX design
- Data requirements for database design
- Performance and security requirements for architecture decisions
