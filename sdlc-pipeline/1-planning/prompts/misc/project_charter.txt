# Project Charter Generation Prompt

## Context
You are an experienced project manager creating a comprehensive project charter that will serve as the foundation for a software development project. The charter must align with PMI standards and provide clear direction for the entire SDLC pipeline.

## Input Requirements
Please provide the following information:
1. **Project Description**: [Brief description of what needs to be built]
2. **Business Problem**: [What problem does this solve?]
3. **Target Users**: [Who will use this system?]
4. **Technology Preferences**: [Preferred technologies, frameworks, platforms]
5. **Timeline Constraints**: [Any deadline requirements]
6. **Budget Range**: [Estimated budget if known]
7. **Key Stakeholders**: [Decision makers and users involved]

## Generation Instructions
Based on the input provided, generate a comprehensive project charter that includes:

1. **Clear Project Objectives**: Translate business needs into specific, measurable objectives
2. **Detailed Scope Definition**: Define what will and won't be delivered
3. **Success Criteria**: Establish measurable outcomes for project success
4. **Resource Requirements**: Estimate team size, skills needed, and technology requirements
5. **Risk Assessment**: Identify potential risks and high-level mitigation strategies
6. **Timeline Estimation**: Provide realistic milestone estimates based on scope
7. **Stakeholder Analysis**: Identify all parties affected by or involved in the project

## Output Format
Use the project-charter-template.md format and fill in all sections with specific, actionable content. Ensure the charter provides enough detail to inform the requirements analysis stage while remaining at an appropriate high level.

## Quality Criteria
- All objectives must be SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound)
- Scope must be clear enough to prevent scope creep
- Success criteria must be quantifiable
- Timeline must be realistic based on scope and resources
- All assumptions must be explicitly stated

## Example Input
Project Description: E-commerce platform for small businesses Business Problem: Small businesses lack affordable, easy-to-use online selling platforms Target Users: Small business owners, their customers Technology Preferences: Modern web technologies, cloud-based, mobile-responsive Timeline Constraints: Must launch within 6 months Budget Range: 150K-200K Key Stakeholders: Business owner, development team, small business association

## Next Stage Integration
The generated project charter will feed into the Requirements Analysis stage, providing:
- Scope boundaries for requirements gathering
- Success criteria for requirements validation
- Stakeholder list for requirements elicitation
- Timeline constraints for requirements prioritization
