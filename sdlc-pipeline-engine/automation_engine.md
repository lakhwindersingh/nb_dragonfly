# Automated SDLC Pipeline Engine

## Overview
An automated pipeline engine that orchestrates AI-powered SDLC stages with intelligent prompt chaining, artifact management, and external repository integrations.

## Architecture Components
- **Pipeline Orchestrator**: Core workflow engine
- **AI Prompt Processor**: Handles AI model interactions
- **Artifact Manager**: Manages generated artifacts and metadata
- **Repository Connectors**: Integrates with external systems
- **Workflow Designer**: Visual pipeline configuration
- **Monitoring Dashboard**: Pipeline execution tracking

## Key Features
- Visual workflow designer (n8n-style interface)
- Multi-AI model support (OpenAI, Anthropic, Azure OpenAI)
- Dynamic prompt chaining with context passing
- Conditional branching and parallel execution
- Rich repository connector ecosystem
- Approval gates and human-in-the-loop workflows
- Version control for pipelines and artifacts
- Comprehensive audit trails
